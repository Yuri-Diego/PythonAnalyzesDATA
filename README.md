## ðŸ“ƒ Description

This project aims to analyze the possible causes of customer churn in a company, using the Python programming language for data analysis. In this project, we will investigate the reasons that lead customers to cancel their services with the company. Data sets containing information about customers who have churned, such as demographic data, purchase history, customer support interactions, and other relevant factors, will be used.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Collect and preprocess data, performing necessary cleaning and transformations.
- Use data visualization techniques to gain initial insights and identify patterns.
- Perform exploratory analysis, data mining, and apply machine learning to investigate the possible causes of customer churn.
- Create predictive models to identify factors contributing to churn.
- Provide conclusions and recommendations in order to reduce the number of customer cancellations and improve customer satisfaction and retention.
